# TS_AWS_Assignments **Write about OLTP and OLAP**
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):
-> OLTP databases function as a "single source of storage" and are designed to handle many tiny transactions.
-> OLTP systems are commonly used in day-to-day operations of businesses such as retail sales, banking transactions, order processing, and inventory management.
-> Examples of OLTP databases include Oracle Database, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
Example: A website for online movie ticket sales is an example of an OLTP system. If two people wish to reserve the same seat for the same film at the same time, 
the ticket will be awarded to the person who completes the transaction first. It's important to remember that OLTP systems are built for transactional priority rather than analytical data.
Benefits:
1. The primary advantage of utilizing OLTP services is their ability to execute queries quickly, allowing them to react to user actions instantly.
2. The user can read, write, and delete data quickly with the use of OLTP services.
3. OLTP ensures the consistency of data, any changes made by one user will reflect for all other users.
4. OLTP provides high levels of security by implementing various security features such as authentication, authorization and encryption to ensure that only authorized users can acess the data.
5. It is scalable and can handle increased number of users and transactions.
Drawbacks:
1. OLTP services is not fail-safe. If there is hardware failures, then online transactions gets affected.
2. OLTP systems are not meant for sophisticated analysis or reporting; rather, they are meant to manage operational tasks. They are not able to quickly compile and evaluate vast volumes of data.
