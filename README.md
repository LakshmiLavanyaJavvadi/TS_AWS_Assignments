**OLTP**
*OLTP is characterized by many short on-line transactions (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
These transactions involve inserting, updating, or deleting small amounts of data in real-time. OLTP systems are optimized for fast response times and are crucial for day-to-day operational tasks.
OLTP queries are simple and easy to understand. These queries typically involve basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and are optimized for fast transaction processing.
