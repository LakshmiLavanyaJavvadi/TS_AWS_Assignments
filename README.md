# TS_AWS_Assignments **Write about OLTP and OLAP**
-> OLTP databases function as a "single source of storage" and are designed to handle many tiny transactions.
-> OLTP systems are commonly used in day-to-day operations of businesses such as retail sales, banking transactions, order processing, and inventory management.
Example: A website for online movie ticket sales is an example of an OLTP system. If two people wish to reserve the same seat for the same film at the same time, 
the ticket will be awarded to the person who completes the transaction first. It's important to remember that OLTP systems are built for transactional priority rather than analytical data.
